It is \\nwhen a borrower receives something of value now, usually cash, and \\nagrees to repay the lender back on a later date. Usually, the borrower \\nalso has to pay interest, or a percentage of the value they borrowed, \\nin addition to paying what they originally owe. For example, let’s say you’ve \\nalways dreamed of buying a \\nhouse. You do your best to \\nsave whatever money you \\ncan towards a fund to pay \\nfor the modest house of your \\ndreams. One day, you receive a \\nwell-paying job offer very close \\nto the neighbor', 'hood you’ve \\nalways envisioned your dream \\nhouse to be. You go around the \\nneighborhood and find a house \\navailable for sale. It’s perfect for your needs: \\nenough space for you and your \\nfamily and it’s within walking \\ndistance from your new, well-\\npaying job. You look at your \\nsavings fund and see that it \\nisn’t enough to buy this house, \\ndespite your best efforts. What \\ndo you do? This could be an \\ninstance when getting credit \\nor taking out a loan would be \\nbeneficial for you. From 5-6 to credit cards, credit or \\nutang is a familiar part of Filipino \\nculture. Credit can help you get \\nthrough financial emergencies \\nlike sudden hospital bills. It \\ncan also help you finance those \\nnecessary expenses that are too \\nexpensive to pay for without a \\nlittle help, like a car or a house.\\nIn the last chapter, we talked \\nabout how insurance was a way \\nof protecting yourself and your \\nfamily financially. \\nThink of credit as a different kind \\nof protection.

Well, it depends.\\nThere are situations where going \\ninto debt can be a step towards \\nyour own financial freedom. \\nExamples of this can be when you \\ntake out a loan to buy a home, a \\ncar, or to start a business.

But you \\ndon’t have to be a rich investor \\nto find financial success \\nthrough investing.\\nIn fact, investment products \\nnowadays are designed with \\nthe average Filipino in mind. \\nMany banks and businesses offer \\neasy and affordable investment products that allow you to \\nbegin investing. There are even \\nlegitimate mobile applications \\nthat allow ', 'you to invest through \\nyour cell phone. The possibilities \\nwith investing are almost endless. \\nAll you need is a little know-how \\nto begin your journey. CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n43WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN \\nSAVING VS. INSURANCE VS. INVESTMENT?\\nIn a previous chapter, we \\ndiscussed savings which is the \\nportion of your income you \\nchoose to set aside for many \\nreasons, including emergencies \\nor large expenses. Savings are \\nusually (but not always) placed \\nin a savings account and may be \\nwithdrawn at any time. Savings \\nare, essentially, money you \\nalready have that you are \\nkeeping for a rainy day.We’ve also discussed insurance. \\nAn insurance carries with it certain \\nbenefits that an investment \\ndoes not. Insurance policies are \\nusually exempt from estate taxes, \\nspecific to medical coverage, \\nand contain a clear procedure for \\ninheritance in case of unforeseen \\ncircumstances. This is because \\ninsurance policies are meant to \\nbe a means to secure yourself or \\nyour family agai', 'nst emergencies \\nor unforeseeable calamities. On the other hand, investments \\nare more of a means to grow \\nyour money.  Investments are, \\nat heart, profit-making activities \\nwhere you, the investor, part with \\nyour money in the hope that it will \\nmultiply. Think of it like entering \\ninto a business. You enter into a \\nbusiness in order to make your \\ninitial investment (or capital) \\nearn you more money (profits). \\nThe same goes for investments. \\nThe initial money you put into \\nthe investment product is your \\ncapital. Any money you earn from \\nit are your profits. \\nWHAT ARE THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS?\\nIn general, there are two main types of investments: fixed income and variable income . Fixed income grows at a steady, predictable rate \\nover time. Variable income can gain and lose you money over time.\\nVariable income investments  are investments \\nwhere the growth of your capital can change \\nfrom one period to the next. These are usually \\nriskier investments. However, they have the \\npotential', ' to earn you more money than fixed \\nincome investments. Fixed income investments are investments \\nwhere the money you receive will not change \\nfrom one period to the next. Your money grows \\nat a steady rate over time. These are more safe \\nand predictable investments. However, they \\nusually earn you less money than variable \\nincome investments.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n44There is no “better investment” between \\nfixed or variable income. Which to invest in \\nall depends on your goals and risk profile.Given these definitions, which \\nkind of investment would you \\nprefer? Why? \\nAsk a friend or the person \\nseated beside you which type of \\ninvestment they prefer and why. \\nDo you have the same answer or a \\ndifferent answer?\\nChances are, your answer will \\nbe unique to you. Between fixed \\nincome and variable income \\ninvestments, there is no “better” \\ninvestment. Which investment \\nto take depends on your risk \\nappetite or profile. Some people \\nwould rather take the risk of \\na variable income', ' if it means getting a higher payout at the \\nend of the day. They are known \\nas aggressive investors. Others \\nprefer the safety of a fixed income \\ninvestment even if it means \\ngetting a lower payout compared \\nto a variable income investment. \\nThese are conservative investors. \\nAgain, it all depends on what\\nyou prefer.\\nLet’s use an example. The \\nsimplest kind of fixed income \\ninvestment is the time deposit. \\nThe graph below will show you \\nthat in this kind of investment,\\nthe money you initially put in \\nmight not even have doubled \\nafter 30 years!PESOSFixed Income - Time Deposit\\nTime Deposit, 2% per year\\nNUMBER OF YEARS\\nAfter 30 years, your money doesn’t even double.

If you started investing \\nin 2006 in a pool of stocks that \\ninclude stocks from PLDT , Globe, \\nand Ayala Land for example, your \\ninvestment would have more than tripled in those 30 years. However, \\nthat growth isn’t consistent. There \\nwill be times when the value of \\nyour stocks will dip below the \\nvalue of the amount you originally \\ninvested. In this example, your \\nstocks lost value in 2008–2009.\\nVariable Income - Stocks\\nYEARS\\nInvesting in stocks is a waiting game.

The two most common are  the Ponzi \\nscheme and the pyramid scheme. IDENTIFYING AND \\nAVOIDING FINANCIAL \\nFRAUD AND SCAMS\\nA Ponzi scheme  is a scam \\nthat relies on the investments \\nmade by new investors to pay \\nearlier investors, making these \\npayments look like returns or \\nprofits from product sales. Ponzi \\nscammers promise high rates \\nof return with very little risk. \\nDon’t be fooled! Those returns \\nonly come from payments made \\nby newer investors like you. \\nThis means that you will only \\nsee a sizable return for your \\ninvestment if the scheme is able to recruit more people \\nafter you.  This is a very unstable \\nsystem and is likely to collapse \\nbefore you ever see the ea', 'rnings \\npromised to you.\\nSimilar to the Ponzi scheme, \\na pyramid scheme  relies on \\npayments made by newer \\n“recruits” to pay older investors. \\nThis fact is usually hidden \\nbehind a “product” that \\nmembers must sell. But beware: This product is \\nusually worthless or difficult \\nto sell . \\nIn a pyramid scheme, your \\nreturns depend largely on how \\nmany people you are able to \\nrecruit into the scheme and how \\nmany people your recruits are, \\nin turn, able to recruit. Like the \\nPonzi scheme, this business is \\nvery unstable and is likely to fail \\nbefore you ever see returns on \\nyour investment.  Ponzi and pyramid schemes use money you pay as a new investor to pay earlier investors their “returns.” Models \\nlike this only benefit initial investors (who may also be involved in the scam) and will always collapse, leaving you \\nwithout any profit on your initial investment.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n51To avoid Ponzi or pyramid schemes, consider the following questions before investing: \\nRememb', 'er that no legitimate businesses or investments \\nhave new recruits/investors as their main source of \\nfunds. If you find yourself in a situation where you are \\nbeing made to invest in such a business, don’t pursue it. \\nYou are most likely getting scammed.If the answer to any of these questions \\nis YES , you might be entering a \\npyramid scheme. Does the business you are investing in focus \\non recruitments or cash investments?\\nDoes it market products with little or no \\nreal value?\\nDoes it promise high interest or returns on \\ninvestment within a short period of time?\\nAre members compensated based on \\nnew recruits and downlines?Interactivity Portion! \\nClick on the checkboxes \\nthat apply to your \\nsituation!CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n52Here are some tips to avoid financial scams and frauds:\\n#1: Consider how \\nthe business you are \\ninvesting into makes \\nmoney.#2: Examine the \\npromise they are \\nmaking.#3: Do a quick Google \\nsearch.\\nDoes the business focus on Does the business focus on \\nrec', 'ruitments or cash investments? recruitments or cash investments? \\nDoes it market products with Does it market products with \\nlittle or no real value?

            "To be a good investor, consider the following key principles:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Educate Yourself**: Understand the basics of investing, including different types of investment products (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.), how the market works, and the risks involved. Familiarize yourself with investment terminology to avoid confusion.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Know Your Investment Personality**: Assess your risk appetite. Are you aggressive, conservative, or somewhere in between? This will guide your investment choices. For instance, aggressive investors might opt for equity funds, while conservative investors might prefer money market funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Do Your Research**: Before investing, thoroughly research the investment products and businesses you are considering. Look for legitimate sources of information and consult with knowledgeable friends or family members.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Ask Questions**: Don’t hesitate to ask questions about anything you don’t understand. A legitimate investment company will be happy to provide you with the information you need.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Start with Sufficient Savings**: Ensure you have enough savings set aside for emergencies before you begin investing. This will provide a safety net and reduce the risk of needing to withdraw your investments prematurely.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Invest Only What You Can Afford to Lose**: Be realistic about the potential for loss. Only invest money that you can afford to lose without impacting your financial stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Diversify Your Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes and sectors to reduce risk. Diversification can help protect your portfolio from significant losses.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Stay Informed and Updated**: Keep track of your investments and stay informed about market trends and economic conditions. Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as necessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Be Cautious of Scams**: Be aware of common investment scams, such as Ponzi and pyramid schemes. If an investment opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always conduct due diligence.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **Consult Professionals**: If you're unsure about your investment choices, consider consulting with a financial advisor or investment counselor who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these principles, you can build a solid foundation for successful investing and work towards achieving your financial goals.\n"
